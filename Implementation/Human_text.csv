"The first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree about that, cause me personal i don't have issues with no one around me. Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that. If you only have personality that good or have charisma that even greater to have, sighing out.                "
"Of course that i'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me "" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm"".

I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!.

The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example:

In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time.

For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm.

In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you.

In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it.

In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't.

Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want.

In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: "" Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent "", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm."
"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life.

One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better.

Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful.

Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts."
"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fan's are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on."
"Has it ever crossed your mind that people today are struggling to make their own decisions, and wanted feedback from other people and just maybe wanted to change their mind. Well people today are just going what their own decisions they make, I am the type of person to ask for some feedback or ask other people about, is this a good choice im making, can I do something better then what I did yesterday. I believe that people should take other peoples' guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter due to people wanting help in the real world, and also tell them about the past so they do not mess up on there life choices.

What is more important the choices you make or the outcome of it? Teenagers about my age need to make better choices, but why you may ask. Today Teenagers are just ruining their own life in school. Teens need to focus on what is right for them making better decisions, like not to drink, help mom out in the kitchen, and do something productive. Teens decisions now can affect the decisions they will make sometimes in the future. For example I changed one of my friends decisions to not drink because that will cause him in the long run, like ever makes it big and someone sends that picture to social media his life can be ruin. Therefore I think teens or people should also ask other people that have already or still is living for a better decisions in important matters.

Why should I go to someone else for a better decisions for some dumb reason they are going to give me, wrong. If you ask someone, you should actually listen to see what they have to say and understand the concept. It is better to have someone else opinion on how to change my decisions. Well they have lived longer than you have, they have more experience,and more life choice taking. All im trying to say is that in my opinion is that you should always take someone else decision because maybe it will help other people in the long run. Maybe it will lead them to build something amazing, start their brand company. Just something between those lines. Someone else decisions can actually change the person you are right now. I've had so many people bring me down on how I'am going to never make it the Army branch. I'm just gonna be a lawn mower, a person who just cuts grass for living. Even though they making money that not my passion. My recruiter told me to never let someone enter your head with bad thought and let them struggle you with these bad thoughts. One of his saying was ""yesterday was the past,today is the present,and tomorrow is a mystery"".

In conclusion People should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about matters due to people needing a little more help, telling them stories about the past so they dont go through that rough past and make the same mistakes. I agree that some people may not what to interact with other people or even care about what they want to say. I agree but if you just hear them out they might just convince you to change your mind. All I'am just trying to say if you do not like the hits or opinion they are trying to give you just back off and find someone new or just go with the flow and follow what your heart attends you to do.

"Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.

The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.

The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.

The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class.

Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life. That was the reason why attend classes better than onine learning at home. "
"Working alone can be more beneficial because you can work at your own pace and we all have different levels, in that case we do not have to argue with anyone about putting your own ideas. Although other may think working with a group is better and more beneficial.

Also, working alone can be more beneficial because you can work at your own pace. Working at your own pace is very important, you will not make mistakes and if you do it is totally fine because that is where we learn from. You may be the type of person that likes working little by little every night instead of doing it all at once. You will not have people over your house horse playing instead of helping you out and working with you on your project. When working alone you do not have to worry about all these concerns because you will be the only responsible one for your own work.

Working alone is more beneficial and can be very helping, it will prepare you for the real world. When working alone you may write or put what you think is correct, your friends will not be there to tell you that you are incorrect. You might be a independent person and prefer to work by yourself. You do not have to worry about someone rushing you because you should know when the due date is. While working alone you just have to worry about you, and finishing your work of course.

Although, others may think it is more beneficial working with a group. Working with a group can bring a lot of distractions. Research determined that when it comes to group projects people complain and prefer to work independently. Also, why would you want to work with others if you do not know if they are in the same level as you. When working with a group you have to check up on your group members to see if they finished there part of the project, if they are not responsible enough to finish it themselves you have to fill in for them because it is a group project and project grade.

Does it not feel much better working alone? You can work at your own pace and we all do not have the same mentality, so we do not have to argue with anyone about putting your own ideas and what you think is correct. Let me tell you a little secret, working with a group can be pretty complicated. Always working alone, it is more beneficial.        "
"I agree because there might be some kids out there who say that they want shorter school time and maybe some don't want that but i think there should be shorter school time. The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TV's and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv. And theres places that you can learn math too.

The reasons of why i think its fair for having shorter school time is because sometimes you learn something that you've learned already and in the other hand its just not fun anymore either i mean for some other kids they think its fun and some not. And also i've seen on twitter that they been hating on the guy who tells us if school is closed or not and people always hope that school is closed because no one is really looking foward to go to school on a monday and my opinion going to school on a monday is the worst and some other people might think the same as well.

Some celebreties became famouse for example Eminem who is a rapper he dropped out of highschool and he became famouse for something that he likes to do i would do the same if i didn't what to go to highschool but i wont because i have really good friends and all the years i've known them i just can't leave them like that.

I guess it just wont be fair y'know to leave someone you've known for awhile and just become famouse and while there in school working hard.

I guess we could all agree that we should have shorter school time because what if your doing something and you don't get to finish your project or something important you'll have to wait intill you get out of school and then come back and what if theres traffic and then you get home around 8:30 to 9:00. You wont have that much time to finish your project but if you live close to the school then i can't complain but i agree to this because like how i said we have phones,computers,and TV's and on the internet you could learn anything you want for an example you could learn about 10th grade stuff even though your an 8th grader maybe your interested in that.

My point here is that we should have shorter school time because nowadays we could learn by ourselfs and for the preschool kids and kindergarden kids they should stay there a little longer because they are toddlers and they can't learn anything by them selfs but for us we should i have shorter time in school hopefully you could understand. I don't want this to effect anyone but like it'll just make all the kids who go to school have more time when they have to do something important instead of coming home late and barely have anytime to finish there project or anything they need to do but thats my point of view.

"When you have a problem do you think to yourself, how can I do my best to fix this problem? American jazz legend Duke Ellington said,""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" In my opinion, I agree with Duke Ellington's quote. One reason, is if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.

I agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.

I also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.

Another reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice. Finally, it is important to do your best in a situation because it would make you improve yourself from your mistakes.

In conclusion, I agree with this quote because you should always try to do your best in a problem. First, you wouldn't regret at least trying to solve a problem. Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it. Finally, if there is a problem it's also chance for you to show others what you can do.      "
"Dear Principal:

I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.

That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says "" If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport"". That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport. Their is a lot of students in SCHOOL_NAME that don't have good grades and cant participate i"
"Technology has a lot of the positive and negative side to it. In the positive side technology comes in handy a lot you can shop online , pay a lot of your bills online and do a whole lot. In the negative side you loose contacts with humans cause every person abuses technology , people always on their phones , people losing eye to eye conversion with each other.

technology will always have a good or bad side in way how humans use it.

In the positive way of technology , a lot people use technology to shop online , a lot of times people try to find the products that he or she wants to find in the store and its to expensive to buy in store , people find it more cheaper products online than outlet stores. Not only people shop online, people also use technology to buy programs that colleges recamend them to use. It helps a lot of people that are in college that do a lot of homework a lot teachers assign homework online than paper. technology always advance everyday in a good way to enjoy. A lot of high school students use technology to do homework for a class that the students miss that day he or she was absent.

technology keeps everyone in check and organized. But yet even if theres a lot of positive stuff about it ,

there's a lot negative things about technology.

In the negative part of technology ,

a lot people thats on their phone ignores the person that he or she was having a conversation with.

The main big problem right now is that people are abusing technology by texting and driving while using their phones , a lot of people are getting distracted on the road cause they want to answer their text message but most of the time people that answer gets into a car crash for getting distracted.

Theres always gonna be a bad and good ways about technology it all depends how humans use technology.

The way I see people using technology its good cause it a lot easier to organize important documents , shop online , doing homework for school and everyday technology will always advance each day.

The only problem thats bad about technology its that us humans getting distracted easily by using our phones , playing games on console , and getting distracted easily. Theres always gonna be a bad and good towards technology it all the depends how humans use it.

Technology is the best thing we have in our world. It makes life more easier for us to do stuff online. Technology will be there for us when we need it to organize documents , buy stuff online , and it will always advance. technology will always have a positive and negative side to it but most of the time its positive. it all depend how humans use it. thats what I think about my side technology the bad and the good.

"I think that it's a bad idea to put more hours of school beacause after school people,students and teachers have to do important stuff like take there kids to soccer or go to a doctors appointment and thats the only time that we have free to do are important missions and there are teacher's that live far they could live in Generic_City and other places that are far. And if we make it longer there are going to be parent's that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and it's like 5pm-6pm it's stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you can't to beacause they put more time in School.

And i think it sucks beacause there are kids that go to my school that live in Generic_City and it take along time to come to school and go back home from school beacause i've lived in Generic_City before and it suck when i stay after school i get home like at 7pm-8pm and it's sucks so it better to not make school longer beacause there are kid that live pretty far and there are going to get home late and then they have to get there homework done too. so it's dummy hard work to get that on time. And us as chidren its going to ruined are shecdule and are parent's to maybe we have not go to soccer or any activity that we take just beacause they put more time in school it going to suck being in a class room for 80 mintues now. it's to be trieding.

They meant if we get a half an hour of more school they start giving us more homework then we mostly get and doing that for just 3 hours that we get just beacause they want to add more time it's going to be hard for everybody and they teacher if they live far it's going to be hard beacause at 6pm thats when all rush hour are so much traffic and there going to come home late and when they come home late there going to be grading work and then waking up at 5pm to go back to work and that trieding doing that smae rountine for there whole life it hard I dont even go to work and i'm like wow if that happens it going to be bad.

Another thing that why would should have on more half an hour is beacause we wake up early and have another half hour kicking ints not far if they want to do that they should a least change they school time and wake up like at 8am or something beacuase its not far wake up early and then leaving so late it should be the oppsite wake up late and leave school early it going to be better beacause then everybody going to kbe happeir no one is going to be in a bad mood and it's going to be chill and then .

Anothe thing way we should have an half an hour of school left it's beacause we the 8th grader we get lunch at 1:40 and then haveand half and hour of school were going to have lunch at 2:10 or something I arleadly hate that and i dont wanna be starving beacause then i wont to my work beacause how hungry I i'm going to get mad i'm going to get hangry and having busdriver taking the kid home at 6pm its going to suck beacause they need there time too for they could do stuff and have time with there family's and there going back and forth it sucks for them having ti puck up kids late and stuff and taking them home."
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in the world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Currently your accomplishments, acts, and attitude speak of you and how great you are, around the world many of the people think do something else is a act of a humble person for example: on your career, your area of work, in the school you do something it's not your responsibility,the people gesture the big heart has and how important it is show to the world you trying make something else to dial the different. I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons gonna be like you, second you gonna be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you.

First being yourself is important because other person they gonna be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter it's no your job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many person they gonna be like you

Second being yourself is important because you gonna be inspiration for everyone, in many area like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person.

Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc.

In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world."
"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.

"What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it.    "
"Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits.

One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to his mom's immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game.

Another reason is some students have no financial support. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems.

Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school.

Graduating within three years is a good idea it helps students end up with their high school diploma while also helping there problem. I agree that gradating within three years is a good idea for students who need and choose it. "
"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.        "
"Is it a good idea to finish high school in three years than four years?

Four years is to long to graduate from high school. In four years you do a lot of things you can participate in many activities. For example: sports, clubs and help the teachers. High school is an important and necessary step to get to the successful, is a requirement in life because of the education and the things that you should learn. The school will help you in life to know how to act and guide you in what is better and you get a better life with school.

School should be just 3 years instead of four. In four years the student learn more, but I don't think is necessary to be in the school all that time. Three years of high school is a challenge. The student have to be after school and take classes during summer is a lot of stress and a lot of things to do, but is not impossible. If the student want to success in life it doesn't matter how much time it will take the only thing that is important is to accomplish the goals.

I am agree with the idea to finish high school in 3 years, I think that 3 years are enough for the student to learn all the stuff that needs. high school is hard but not impossible to finish, and is a good idea to push the students to graduate before, there are better opportunities and the only thing that I think when someone is telling me that I have to be more time in the school is ""I'll be old when I'll finish the school"" and that doesn't sound good. It's better 3 years than 4 because, you get a job, you get on the college earlier and you accomplish your goals before what you expect.

Most of the kids are looking for end the school early, is a good motivation for the students that they will end the school early. In that way maybe the majority of the teenagers will be more focus on what they are doing, and have a better future. The majority of the people when is young always think about that they leave school because they don't want to end when they get old. That's why I like the idea. Before you finish high school, before you get in the college and you do not finish the university to old. Plus, you have better opportunities and also you don't waste your time.

Even four years is not a bad idea because you do more and you learn more and you can get more information. You have the same facilities even if you finish early or you take more time. Four years Is good but not all the students like to do the same thing in that time and they get bored. Four years is a good option, but three years or less sound better. Both options have a good opportunity to be in a good university. It just depends on what the student wants to do and what decision it will make. "
"Some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Others think that inactivity also serves a purpose. They argue that they are not focus and they are not learning. One should always accomplish a goal if one puts their mind to it. they gain new knowledge,skills, and information.

If one has the knowledge he can accomplish anything. I wanted to learn how to make a dog house. I had no knowledge on how to build a dog house. My friend had told me that the school was having a science fair and that they were giving knowledge on how to build a dog house. I went and I had got the knowledge that i needed. I had the knowledge to stat it and to finish it. The dog house came out looking pretty good with the help of knowledge that I had. If one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has the skills to accomplish a goal he can can do anything. When i was in school I wanted to improve my skills in English. I would ask mt teacher to give me tips on what I needed to improve. She would tell me me not to use the word you. By the end of the year I was not using the word you. She had told me that my English skills were improving because I had been working on it all year. She told me that i was a strong writer. If one has the knowledge, skills , and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has information he can accomplish any goal in his way. When i was in high school I wanted to take welding as a class. I had no information on how to join the class. I asked my friend on how i could join he told me that I had to go to the office to get the information that I needed. With the information that I got I now had to fill it out so that I could join the class next year. if one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If everybody in the community had the Knowledge ,skills, and the information then everybody would accomplish a goal. Although others think that they should not be focused on accomplishing a goal. One should have theses skills so that they can accomplish anything that they want.         "
"Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you.

My older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.

People will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Im not saying people should't have rolemodle just don't do something because someone else did it do it better then they ever could. My friend Generic_Name wanted to be a football player his whole life he was the best in our middle school team, but his mom and dad hated the idea they thought all football players end up hurt so he did't play in high school he did't like any other sports so he just went to school and went home. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today.

Making your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You can't live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own.

Those are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and did't do what they said to do then they don't deserve to be in your life."
"Summer is a hot and nice season and most students need time to enjoy the break and here is why, so first off most students go on vacation out of state or country to visit family members and they stay longer than three to four weeks. When visitng family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you wont get to see them often when you leave. Even if the student stays for two weeks and the student returns they will not have enough time to do their summer assignments or to gather materials for school. One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax.

Also when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. I mention these type of activities because they are not available in other seasons like fall, winter, and spring. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Although a longer break would be nice for the winter, all we need to have is two weeks for Christmas and New Years.

We need to have more time to learn and be prepared for future exams, especially if some students do not have good grades and are falling behind on their work. Some may argue that two months and a couple days is too much, but parents would not like it if their child was starting to stay home and not go to school. We need to have all the time in the world to be educated and be caught up on all missing assignments. Finally it might seem that most students will forget information during the summer, it will not matter because the student will not be learning the same information as last year."
"I think that imagination is not more important then knowledge, so I disagree with this statement that Albert Einstein made. It know for a fact that I use knowledge more than imagination.

Some reasons why i disagree are if you don't know anything you cant imagine anything. You might be asking your self why? But the simple answer is that if you don't know anything, you also won't know what to imagine. Without knowledge you can't imagine and create or do stuff.

Next reason is that, I think knowledge counts as experience and experience could save you from getting hurt or killed. I know that if I got burned because I sipped from o mug full of hot coffee, I would not sip from it again until it cools down because I have experienced the burn.

My last reason is that, sometimes when i use my imagination, I use it to create or do something and make it creative. But you can't make it creative if you dont know what creative you are looking for. One example is when i had to make my name out of macaroni and cheese.

That was my reasons and what I think, what do you think? In conclusion I disagree because its just obvious to me that knowledge is more important than imagination. Do you agree or disagre with me?"
"I agree with this prompt many cases it is impossible say the people but i will tell you something we can, many peoples says is impossible to change the world, and you know what we can is something is on our head that keeps blocking, i think it is our priority number one, change the world, change our vision of watch our environment,

the people needs to change to see the real thing that is happening on our environment, change one little thing is a big change does not matter what but the change began, i would say among the world and our life, do you think our life are safe i say no because the global warning it is on us, and we can change it of course, the thing is nobody it is gonna get up until someone do, what we have been doing is not wright, the change is coming. We have been doing a lot of work every day and you know what for global warning, know let's talk about the people many peoples say can't change them self because is hard, it is impossible, no one will see change on my, and many other thing but peoples need to change their behavior, among the day peoples feels tired because they had bad day or they do many work. but i will never give up because as the tree can change the leaf to another color i can change the world one thing i can change myself but we can change it as a team with many other peoples, is better together than alone the change will even bigger and bring many others countries and join us, if i can change myself i can change another peoples to see the real life in what we live. I want to talk about me i really want to change myself because many other peoples needs me to help them be courteous, kind, responsible, on time and try to do better on what i do, change myself and the life of peoples it is my priority number one, if i know what is write and what is wrong i know what i gonna do change the impossible to possible nothing is this world is perfect nobody but we have to support other in what they need, we have to be happy of our self from the right thing we have been doing and up coming. I like technology and electricity those are the to matter i want to study with technology i would like to build a personal robot because everybody wants one and help in the day with the task of the home i know that will cause dangerous because can damage itself with an update or make it crazy but that can change the life yes everybody will be happy and peoples can rest better, with the electricity i would like to do the first smart phone that can charge with the sun because can not be generate a lot of energy. Is never too late you can make many thing as you can but if you make it you are right is not wrong make mistake i can tell you one thing is good because you can learn from them if you never make mistake you are wrong the mistake are the key to successful to change the bad thing to the right. You are my passion to live my mom say and you can change the world or may be not because in your head there is your world where you can build many thing to help peoples maybe you can not build a big change but one little thing is more bigger that i big thing, the change is coming very soon around the corner. but the change is not enough many peoples think the opposite and they never will change their minds that the bad thing are right and is very sad see peoples thinking about it they need to open their eyes and see what is really happening around their environment. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change this prompt is easy to understand because in the actuality there are many impressions that can never change of course others can do it but not a lot will be agree, sometimes i don't know what to write i write what i see, i heard, and touch my experiences to change are really small but the dreams come true sometimes not in the real life but in your head yes if i could dream a big dream to change world and the life for the peoples who need a little help to make their dreams come true and they always will say thanks because you change my whole life and others now is is my turn to change other you did your part now i have to do my part thank you very much. The behavior in the school, in the house, in the community, in the country, in the neighborhood, and with the peoples who you talk those are part of the change, something ugly to something beautiful the change we have to bring it from the house and the teachers are those who change our self from the way to study and get a better future, The most part of everything is get started if we don't do that nobody is gonna get up until i make the first right thing, my teacher say it is important change the way thing are build and get the point you want it, i love the way i think to change anything but i need some extra help many cases i say if i could do one thing is make something like a video or video animation and upload to the social media will be great because many peoples will see the video and they are gonna say this is what i want it, this is what i was looking for and the hole word will see it, i like many others prompt but this is not difficult to say something nothing is impossible everything is possible if you never give up everything is gonna be right and the change you are gonna do is going to be the one of many peoples will be proud of you all, and i am going to finish with this last word, everything you think is wright is write if is the opposite you are right as well just never give up and continue strait, may be if every people can think and put the most of his part will be great at this point you change it, and i will tell you because you already have been change the bad thing to the right the only thing is wait until the process is complete, i make mistakes and you too and we know if we fixed we can change what you want and the make it possible the life is passing too fast and we have to live it like is the last day of our life and never give up. i will try my best the change is near to you."
"In most student's summer time,they learn different things from their break,such as work experience,new knowledge from a book,and tradition about other country;In this cause,teacher's designed is not a good choices for student's project,because teacher can not make suitable choices for students,so the way can help students more understand about what they can do in the summer project is student's designed.

When the summer break start,student can make a lot choices about their plan in the summer,for example,they can stay home,travel to somewhere,or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different,they learn different things from their break,teacher could not really know what happen in student's break,this is why student need designed their own title.

In half way of the summer,some student might not even start making their project,in this cause if teacher give student a hard title,such as""after you read this book,what your opinion and what you learn from this book?"",then student have try rush through the book,and start making a project,it will make student have a bad project content,if student can decide they own project title,such as""base on your break,what you learn from your travel,it can be anywhere"",if student can create their own project title,it will be a lot interesting and easy.

Most student want to learn a new things from interesting activity,and spend a time on those things,and student always know what whey like to do,they can create title base on animals,vehicles,or their life experience,it will be so much fun and efficiency will improve,if they can decide their own project title.

Between teacher's designed and student's designed,student always like to make their own choices,they can learn things from activity they are interesting,talk and share experience with their friends,and have a easy project in their summer time,that's why student's designed better then teacher's designed."
"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.

To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.

To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.

Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.

And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.

In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the ""Success Gate"" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next America's generations."
"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to."
"Establishing a homework club would be a great idea because students can get help. Another reason this is useful to student is because they could finish all her/his work and get more time to do what they want at home. Lastly It gives them an chance to learn more.

Students can get help in a homework club easily. One way they can get help is by asking a teacher for help. Another way a student can get help is asking a friend for help. They can get help with a teacher and a friend. This is how students can get help easily.

Students can finish there work at school. When they finish there work at school they got more time to do whatever they want. They could play games. They could read a book. they could take frequent naps. In conclusion people can do more things when there done with there work.

This gives them a chance to learn more because they can ask more questions and get there work done.

In conclusion they should establish a homework club for the people that need help. Also for the people that want to finish there homework. Thats why they should establish homework club"
"I agree with being honest because holding the truth for so long can hurt a persons feeling wether you know them for long. Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are.

Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love.

Being honest with you family and friends would be the best choice because later on your life you dont have worry about any regrets on your actions on what you did. "
"The technology has improve this years, allows people to makes think much faster than before and the technology every day its going to keep improving. I think that Technology makes thighs more easy for everyone but especially for does that cant walk, speak or heard. Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you dont have a car you can shop online. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary. Technology also makes more easy to talk with people that is far away and you miss. Last year I call my grandmother and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I dont know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me.

Technology is very important this days, for everyone but if we used for good because their is some people that use technology to do bad thinks and that way technology have some negative effects on peoples lives. The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that dont know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology its a tool for human and if we know how to used its going to makes us life much easy.

In my opinion technology its one of the best tool that we have, but we have to lean how to used because it can helps us a lot and makes us much easy many thinks, but there is only one rule we have to used for good."
"Many people believe that success consists of going from failure. because we all human making mistake in our life. being faliure is good for must of peoples. however we all taking lesson from faliure to faliure to be come success in our life. for many resons: fristly,must of students, agree with this statement that Minister Winston Churchill once said. and secondary, part of students did not believe in this statement. however they are thanking we do not want to failure in our life or tests. we want to success once time. previosly must of people agree failure is key is success.

for example: Abraham Lincoln, one of the 16th president of the U.S, once time said in during in civil war said to his people or audience, we have to be strong, does not matter for us how hard is life is it . and he continue his speech he said. whatever success, going from failure to faliure without loos any of enthusiasm. he said never contrition in your past. the constant to be succsess consists of going from failure. and aslo he siad that, this a good convenience for everone in consequence Lincoln, said you guys have to conscious and be awake all the time. this confirm to everyone or to all of us key of failure is in success.

other peoples , did not agree what Abraham Lincoln said. must of them said this is not compulsion or compulsory, they said this is over las conclusive in our decide we want to success one time without lossing any enthusiasm or failure.

In my opinion that "" succcess consists of going from failure to failure without loos of enthusiasm. we agree in this prompt. because before that i said faliure of key is becoming in success in our life we should all battle with failure we all know that way is become austerity. we have to fight with failure we did not want to win us. we want to success,in improve our self.

Many people making a mistake in thier life some of them success, and most of them failure. this is our life.

no mather success congsists of going from failure to faliure. some people dismal when they got failure in thier life.

They are become depression most of them and finally when they got success in thier life they are become happy, and depreciation. of course that"" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."
"Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better.

One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes.

Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better.

Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way.

In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives. "
"MEMORANDUM

I See no problem not a big essue about using cell phones at school,a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents,students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons.

However, some students can take to other side,and don't pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia. Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers don't allow studenst using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach,this can be a rock inside the boot.

"""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"".

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life."
"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes.

dear principal i think they should help to do require community service because some kids don't community service. what about who gets in bigger trouble how to are require to do community service. the kids not in trouble don't how to do community service. it's a good a idea. do you like my option. some people don't like to do community service. they say to much work .i say it not lot work to if you help out. 
"Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Many people may not have experience and never but I'll be a great candidate to hire because I'm hard-working and I'm responsible.

I'm a great candidate that employers are looking for because I spend time volunteering at school and working with job owners as a helper. I take care of people kids and work as a school bookkeeper all school year. however, some people may think having more experience is better than being responsible, having experience help but having responsible help employers trust you more with important job. But I manged how many people check out book out of school and I clean the library some times. Later in the year i volunteer at a two company has a filer. I plan paper for employer because they know that I'm responsible to do the job and get done.

In addition, Im a hard-working person because I have a job and play sport but I my time to volunteer some time. I do a lot of work so I don't have to do anything later or the next day. I was a food stocker at my job but now I'm a manager. Because I work every day and put all my heart to complete my job every day. I never miss a day at work are late I come to work ready I check if every is done if not I do it before the store open and set plan for the day. I put one hundred percent in to everything I do in life to finish with my task. In fact, most people are lazy and don't want to do any work are complete any task there boss gave them, but a hard-worker will get the job done than a lazy person. But I may not have any experience but I'm hard-working and responsible to do my job on time and responsible to do important work for employers and other people that ask for help. Even though I don't have any experience, I'll be a good candidate to hire for the job.       "
"Dear principal I agree with the school cafeteria plans because our health would be better if we eat healthier than chunk food, It will makes us not get obese and fell into depression, healthier food makes your body be more active.

Does healthier food makes your health healthier?, is obesity a problem for students?.

Healthier food would make our health be healthier, Instead of eating chunk food we should eat healthier school lunch ,because If we eat healthier food it will be easier for us to do any sport because when we eat chunk food our stomach feels heavier than when we eat healthier food, professional athletes they maintain their shape because they always eat healthier food.

It will makes us not fell into depression, When we eat chunk food and we don't eat any healthier food it makes us get fat and when we can't stop eating it makes us go to the level that we get obese and when we get obese a lot of students fells into depression because they don't like that way they look after they weight increase.

obesity is a big problem for our health, because it can take you to the level that you will not be able to walk.

Healthier food makes students be more active, when we eat healthier our body don't feel to heavy so we are able to move faster than when we chunk food. Chunk food makes stomach heavier that after we eat it makes so lazy that we don't e want to do anything after lunch. Healthier food activates our brain like when we do exercise we activate our body .

In conclusion i think it's a great idea this new plan, changing the school menu into healthier food because it will make our health be healthier, It will help us not fell into depression, It will make us be more active. healthier food is the best the school cafeteria can do for us because they will help us prevent obesity and they will help us take care of our health."
"Positive Life

Do you have to be positive attitude to have success in the life? The answer for this question yes, because in the life everyone should be positive, and successful in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive. Their are a lot of reason's and evidence to have good life. The most important one is be positive because being positive make the life better. For example, when the person are positive that will make the person have a lot of friends, if the person are positive that makes him/her happy, and the person will pass all his/her test with good score or in his/her job be the smarter one.

First, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because when the person positive that will makes him/her have a lot of friends. For example, Generic_Name always smiling and positive. So, everyone in her school loved her and they want to be friends with her. So, now she is positive girl's with a lot of friend's. Being positive makes the life more better. As well as, if the person are positive he/she will always be happy.

Second, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because that help the person to pass all his/her test with good score or in their job to be the smarter one. For example, Generic_Name student in high school, and after school he works. Even if he has a lot of stuff to do in his school, and with his job, but he is always positive person, he helps anyone need any help, and he always get the highest score in his test. Also he is the good person in his job. Positive person will have the most beautiful life and will live with peace.

Some people may argue that to try to be a positive person because the world we born on sometimes have a lot of problems. That is true because the world looks like the mountain sometimes hard to claim it, and the life looks the same usually it's hard to be happy and positive because sometimes their is a problem or something happened makes you feel sad, and negative, and makes you feel that you hate your life, but everyone have to try to be positive, and to love his/her own life because if the person always negative that will makes him/her sick, sad, mad, and complicate. However, to be positive that will protect you from a lot of problems gonna happened to you.

To summery,

in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive. Just be positive to get the most beautiful life ever. Overall, if anyone want to be positive is not the hard work it's easy, and again relax, and get the good breath, try to lose all the negative ideas. Lastly, enjoy with the positive life. "
"I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a students picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it everyday. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have no dought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it.

Although if the counclours put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own.

in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. The students will become positive and get good grades because they made a decision that could possibly impact their future goals. "
"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.

I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.

While your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.

I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me.

One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said ''its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good."
"I think some student take a class at home because they live to far or they not have any transportation however the students can study for video or for online, but I think that is not benefit because it most better to learn more going to the school, for example the teacher they wants to theirs students learned but something they can put a lot homework because they want to their students learned however some student they live to farm from the school but they take the bus or they take the train and another transportation because they want a do something on the future, but is not bad idea to the students take class on the home because everyone wants to do something on the future for example if you someone wants to do something on the future they need to going to the school or take class for online becuase the school very important however not everybody have the same opportunities.

But I think the online class is not benefit for the students because they can not learn better maybey the students they can not consentrate good at home becuase they distrate for something and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot distrate and they put attention when the teachers theach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.

However some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

The school is very important but some students doest like the school and some students like the school becuase they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the fututre they need to have a dreams because the person doest have a dreams they don due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their childrens becuase some childrens on the world they wants to have any opportunity.

But in my opinion some people is possible to take a class for online maybe is not possible to their going to schools but they can pay classes for online but is not the same like the schools but they can due if they have dreams they can due because everybody have dreams."
"Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're save because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the. That's all I have to say."
"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep."
"For the time students get to high school, Is time for the students to focus more on their future. Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career. And see if there are others career that students would like to take. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. So been able to choose a career before high school helps. Because the student can get their mind set and think about what courses the student wants to take in high school. Those courses can help, because it teach the student the things that he needs to learn therefore hes prepare the career, he wants to take. And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities. So I agree for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. also high school has a lot opportunities, for students that wants to take collage course. So they can be prepare for their careers, and when they get to collage they now a lot about the career they want to take. So it helps committing to a career before going to high school it can get you prepare for your future. And acomplish what you want for your future.    "
"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.

Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.

Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.

In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.

At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.

They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. "
"Working with a group is more beneficial or working alone is more beneficial? Working with a group is more beneficial. People can get help from another person and they can be more successful by working together.

Some people thinks that working alone is more successful. It gives people time to plan and easier to make good efforts. Some people prefers to not work with a group because they might make bad efforts on other people's work. Overall people says that working by yourself is more beneficial, they are wrong because working with a group can help you be more successful.

"It is wonderful how if we are always doining something. If always we doing someting we got more that we think before. We need practice everything. we need practice something that we want.

Do we acoomplish more if we are always doing something. We need think that's what is that we want to acoomplish more that we thing. If I want to be a police I will study hard to be more that a police. I want to buy a iphone 5 but I will work more to buy a iphone 8. I want go to Generic_City with $600 but I will save more to got $1000. We need think before to do something. we need to learnd to save money.

If we doing nothing we never got soemething that we wants. We need to work because if we do not work we never can buy something that we want. if I want pass the SOL of Geometry I need study but if I don't want study i will not pass the SOL. I want a good future but if I doing nothing I will had a future bad I will study and work to had a better future. we need think in the future before doing nothing.

Determine never to be idle. I don't want to be a idle but if i don't be a idle I will never had everythig that I want. I want a car toyota but I will work hard, and think like a idle to work more hard and get more moey to buy a BMW. I need pass all the class to graduate but I want a diploma better that normal one I will doing all homework to pass al the class. we need to be a idle to got everything that we want.

In conclucion, It is wonderful how if we are always doining something. Do we acoomplish more if we are always doing something. Determine never to be idle. But if we want thing that speend a lot money we need to be a idle to got more money, or we want graduate we need study more that other to be better person in the future. for this reason and many other we need to be a idle."
"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. Furthermore parents have to a limitation on their kids and put a limit on them."
"Since I was a little kid my dreamed job has always to be a mechanic, and you might ask why do I want be a mechanic well; when I was little I remember watching my dad fixing cars all day long, at the end of a long day of work I always got played with my bicycle and whenever my bicycle got broken I remember running to my dad telling him to fix it, and I loved watching him fixed it, so whenever I was not with him I always knew how to fix it by myself, when I started to grow I began helping my dad more, he never actually led me work on a car because he said that was it dangerous, but when I was going try

I had to come to the United States and I never learned nothing about car so now that i'm big I'll love to learn more about car and how to be an mechanic.

To be honest I remember telling my dad that one day I was going to be the greatest mechanic of all the time because I wanted him to saw that I could do it and make him feel proud I remember him smiling and telling me that

I could became whatever I wanted to be in this world I just had to worked for it and don't stop until I reached my goal, the only memories I have with my dad are me working with him, we did not spend too much time together I only saw him when he was at work and some weekends because he did not leaved together but now that I'm big and I can make my own decisions and have the opportunity to be anything in this country I want to be an mechanic and make my dad proud.

I know that been a mechanic is not easy and it takes a lot of skills, patience and practice but if I ever get the opportunity i won't waste it i will give my best and i will focus and try to give it all because my that once told me ''nothing is impossible it can be very hard but not impossible'' I'm always having those words in my mind because i'm that type of person that it won't stop until it gets what he wants and all i want is to lean how to be an mechanic and while doing it make my dad proud I'll love to have the opportunity to explore an mechanic company I'll be very thankful for giving me that opportunity.

I'm also looking to be an mechanic because I love cars and when I get a new job I will buy my own car and if learn how to be an mechanic I won't have to pay somebody to fix my car when I could fix it by my own when I always had like and obsession to open stuff and take everything how see how every little thing makes a function and how all together make a hole system works and when I'm finished taking everything out i like to put them all together as before and if put everything how it was maybe thats why i like math so much because in math there are many different ways to salve something and at the end they all give the same answer and cars work almost the same way and I would like to open a car and find what is wrong and see how to fix it and get paid by what i love to do  "
"Have you ever accomplished something in your life? Because people nowadays are very lazy and hard headed because they are easily distracted by social media, people around them, and also the society that's why they cannot focus on their goals in life. Although some might argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish, actually it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished.

One reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because you will gain more knowledge. For instance, based on my personal experience when I was in middle school, I dont do my projects, homework, seat works because I'm too lazy and I just love talking with my friends everyday in our class. However, when I moved here in America last year things have changed because I'm new here in this country and I dont know anyone. I realized that my friends here are not the same like in the Generic_City that I used to talk to everyday. That's why I decided to study hard and make my parents proud again. I have an five A's in my classes right know and I'm proud because I accomplished something. And yes, Thomas Jefferson was right ""Determine never to be idle.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.""

we should never stop doing something that can benefit us. This proves that working on something will help you gain more knowledge in life and dont stop believing in yourself. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my dad's personal experience. My dad was a college graduate in the Generic_City, he dreamed to become a successful businessman and he made it. My dad started a business near to schools and shops so many people will go to his store. The first few months was amazing because his customers was very loyal to him my dad didn't expect that it will happen. Unfortunately, my dad's business went down because something happened that he didn't liked. People are robbing and digging all the way to my dad's store every night. That's why he was forced to closed his business and rest for a while. After a few years he didn't have a job because he was still shocked to what happened to his business. However, he decided to take culinary class to work again because he wants to help our family and to gain more knowledge about baking. After taking the culinary, he went to Generic_City to seek new opportunity. He is now currently working in five star restaurant owned by a rich man in Generic_City. This proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish like what my dad did in his life and he changed for a better living.

Another reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because people will be proud to what you've accomplished. For example, from the movie

PELE

it is about a young boy who dreamed to become a professional football player. He lived in a small house in Brazil and played football with his friends in his neighborhood. Pele was a poor little kid but plays well even he is very short unlike other people in his town. When they play against other teams, they always laugh at them because they dont have a proper gear for playing. And there is a guy who is recruiting players for their club. Pele was the youngest player in the club thats why he was treated like a slave. After few years playing in his club, its his time to shine to represent Brazil in the world cup. Pele scored a lot of goals and Brazil went to the finals. He was so incredible that time no one can stop him and Brazil won the world cup. This proves that you need hard work to accomplish something like Pele he never stop doing what he wanted to be and now people from Brazil and all over the world are proud of him. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish comes from Adidas' quote or saying ""All in or nothing"". For instance, that line is very effective to people especially the athletes around the world because doing your goals in life makes you more stronger and better than the others. And you should give your best all the time and make people proud to what you've done in life. This proves that is it better to work on something to accomplish like the owner of Adidas he became famous and rich because he worked hard, focused on his goals.

The other side will argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish because you will have more time to do what you want or something else. However, it is better to work on something because you can practice your weaknesses. For example, my friend Generic_Name who really dont know how to write a perfect essay but can speak fluent in English. He was really bad in writing essay when we were in middle school. Generic_Name was always shy to read or present his work to our teacher. So, I told him to work with my classmate who is really good in making essay and ask him to teach Generic_Name how to write a perfect essay. After a few weeks of learning, Generic_Name improved his writing skills. This proves that it is better work on something to accomplish like what my friend Generic_Name did he started practicing his weakness and became a good writer. Another example that proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my personal experience. For instance, I've been playing football since 5 years old because my dad is also a football player. When I was playing with my club my coach said my first touch is not really good unlike the other players. However, I practiced by myself like what what coach told me. And my mentality was I should prove my coach that I will be a better football player. This proves that practicing your weaknesses will make you more a better person.

To conclude all these statements above, it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished. We people have different purposes in life, we should never be idle in life."
"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

"78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger."
"I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers and they can ask them if there GPA is low.

there is a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school,or stay after school for more help. There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years.

If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there is some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like. If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. but i feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up. what i like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help.

"While students are in Middle School in 8th grade, they get the opportunity to see many career's and see which one are they planning to take or have an idea of the career. students should have the opportunity to choose their own career, sometimes students are force to take the career that their parents want. Why? because in many occasions they do not have another choose. In this decade teenagers have the right to choose the career that they want to study. In High School students are preparing and learning different elements and different skills, however; learning others skills benefit teenagers in their future. How? and Why? because learning different skills prepared teenagers for any jobs or if they have any kind of problem anywhere. Guiding students for what they like since a young age is an acceptable idea because they learn more and more each day. Their mentality is improving each day. For example: They try to look for information, asking people that already have experiences with the career that they are thinking to take. After Middle School and High School students are ready to start college and they should be assuming what is best for them.

In some parts of the world teenagers do not have the opportunity to go to school, countries that do not have good recursive, for example: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Africa. In those kind of countries many teenagers do not go to school because they prefer to work beside of going to school, their education is not good enough. That is why so many people come to U.S. because they know that the education that U.S brings them is their future. Each Teenager comes with a dream to U.S. Kids at age of 12 of those countries comes with big mentalities with big dreams, that is what helps many teenagers to choose a good career in U.S, at young age they know that they have to make their family proud and be the alpha of the family with a good career. Also as the population in those countries is increasing day by day is harder to find a job even if you had a good diploma it do not matters. The society in those countries when kids want to go to school their parents don't let them, ""the education here is not going to guide you anywhere"" that is what they said, that is why now days are many terrorism in many countries because parents takes the dreams of their children and through them to the trash. Many parents should give teenagers the opportunity of studying and talk them about how important is to have a good education and let them think about the career that they want at young age.

The importance of knowing and thinking about the future at young age has been an impact in now days, because in many cases around the world teenagers do not think about their future, they do not care about school, jobs, education, or their family, but in U.S teenagers have many chances of getting a good job and getting a good healthy life and a great education.

Teenagers will have their life set after High School.

Teenagers are going to be an inspiration for others.

They will have a good job.

Ensuring that students should have their career in mind by the time that they enter to High School for them to learn more and preparing when they get to college and learn much more and be an inspiration for many other teenagers and for others to think of the importance of having a good education and career.

"Does technolgy have a posistive or negative effect in your life? To me it does because it allows me to complete many things without having contact with others. For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone.

Technology can help you in manys ways. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well.

There are so many other ways technology can help you as well. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team. Technology for kids is positive when they are younger than 5. Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things. So that to me is a posetive effect with technology

For sum people negative effects could also be negative for them also. When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you.

To me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it. I also beleive for other people it can help aso for like, work, bank, food and more . But sometimes they can also be negative things but negative things also happen in life so its okay for that to happen. So Technology is good for life becuause it can bring posetive effect."
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. School should allow students to decide if they wanna attend at their school, home, or both. Anyways it's a good idea that some school allow their kids to attend classes from their own house.

Allowing students to attend classes from school is good idea. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Most kids either play sports, have a job, or maybe both. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.

If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.

It wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.

I hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!"
"I agree with Ralph waldo when he said's ""to be your self in a world that trying constantantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments.""

although being yourself is a very hard thing to do especially when you have nobody buy your side though it all at first it seems easy but once you try so hard to make people proud you would wanna feel like fiting in.

But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why cant we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we woulden't care what people think about us but do , but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not theres no alternatives.

Because whats the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try its never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around.

Sometimes our influences may proswade us and to a sertin point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or dont at the end of they day they try but the real question is do they succeed? yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or wont come to our lives.

I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why but we will soon rather then later at first its complicated even difficult although its just tempawarly things that accur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good but we should've been proud of what diden't thad happen.

So i believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy dont worry what people say about you, you know where you stand dont let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people cant always tell what you are they dont define you thats for you to decide not them,So dont be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you.

Thank you for your time hope to hear from you very soon.

"Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. For those who can pay a fee for it would be perfect because they have the material to do that, like enternet, computer, or any other device to joing by online or video conferencing classes. Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who really need it, like students with disability or health problems. It would not benefit students whom have a hundred percent of their ability to develop anything, it would make them more lazy than what they normally are.

Generic_Name is a student who has a hundred percent of his ability but he does not like go to school. He is always skiping classes and never make homework. Generic_Name is a student with health problems who can not assist to school like a normal teenager because he has to be connect to a oxygen tank twenty four, seven. Generic_Name does not want to go to school and Generic_Name can not do that. The school which both of them used to attend is offering a distance learning program for students and the first two students who joing are Generic_Name and Generic_Name. If schools decide to create this program for students, them most priorize at the moment to acept students.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it. The one who is going to be benefit more would be Generic_Name because he is the one who really need this program, he is the one who want to learn new stuff, he is the one who want be someone in the future. Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can. So students can learn and be successful n the future. Remembering that the one that are students right now, are the future of the world. "
"Elementary school students, they are. examples:They don't do the work, They don't care anything, They are funny, Always go outside to play what they wants, In others schools they don't had to go with uniforms, They always be late, The moms pick up to go to the home, he majority of the students had 8-12 years old because they are in elementary school, If you had 13 years old or more you no can't go to elementary school or if you had 5 years old you no can't to.

They do draw, They had the same teacher everyday, They had 4 teachers, one of gym,other of music other of draw and the teacher of scients, math , They go to the lunch 11:30, In the morning in the cafeteria they can take a bag with food inside the bag had apple, milk,juice, and then when they finish the they put the trash in the trash and when is time for lunch they go to the cafeteria and take the food sometimes they eats in the class, Sometimes they eats in the cafeteria to, If you don't speak English you had a teacher of Spanish of depend what language you speak she help you to what do you need, They give a dictionary to you, That helps you to search the word you don't know, They don't fight is rare to see is fight in elementary school, Sometimes happened but is rare when that happened in elementary school, A day in the morning in the cafeteria two boys start to fight that was fast because the security coming to the fight he separe the the guys he take to the office and everything was fine, But in elementary school the fight are fast, In middle school or high school the fight are extreme the security don't cant separe the students because sometimes the others students coming to the fight to sometimes is because they friends are in the fight and they wants to help the friends, Everymorning when you enter to the class i always take a computer and i do what i want that is good, Because that help to learn more English to me.

This important, Because when was in elementary school i see that sometimes the teacher said today everybody had to take the food and coming to the class we are going to wacht a movie, Sometimes we had to go the music class the teacher of music class she was a good teacher, Sometimes we to the draw, Sometimes we had to go to the gym to play soccer, The most what i like of elementary school was the teachers she's always help me in my work,homework, Is important because when i coming of my country i was in elementary school, The first day of school for me was a bad day, Because i don't speak English the teacher asking something to me but how had to answer i don't understating nothing what she is saying to me, Is important to me, Because everyday we go to outside in elementary school we play a lot games like soccer, basketball, the lesson is important, Because i put things happened to my friends, I put things what i see in elementary school"
"I disagree with the school board extending the school day by one and a half hours extra.

Because Students will no have enough sleep with one and a half hours extra of school with homework,

also students will have less free time, and also student wouldn't have enough time to go spend with there family.

If the school board extended the school day by one hour and a half then students wouldn't have enough time to sleep because they have to do there homework , and that take probably one to two hours to finish there homework and then they will have to eat and get ready for bed.

I like have my free time to do mostly what I want to do but if the school board extended's the school by an hour and a half then we wouldn't have as much time for free time and we wouldn't be able to go outside and play with are friends or play video games, everything that you like to do will be shorter.

Do you like spending time with your family I like spending time with family but if the school board extends the school day by one hour and a half then you wont have as much time to be and spend with your family like going outside for a walk or playing games or going out places like to eat and those times are going to be making memories not being in school most of the time.

Thats why I think students shouldn't have school extended one hour and a half so they can have more time to do there homework and have more time to sleep, and so that they can have enough time to play video games and play outside with there friends , and finally so they can spend time with there family and do fun activities with them."
"According to the text I think is a good idea that students can graduate from high school in three years because if you graduate from high school very early you are going to get a lot of opportunities to be successful in life, I also think that if someone decide to start working contraction or hard works like that early, three years later that person going to get a lot of experience and money and if you decide go to college or some like that when you graduate from college you going to be young and ready for life, that's how a lot of people became millinery, because the must time you spend doing something that's more experience that you going to get, and when you got experience and you know what you doing, and what you want you life going to be better and easier in the future.

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you don't going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" that's wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and that's going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so you're going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level.

I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him

"" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school' then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that' s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything.

Another thing is that not everybody make it,

is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad don't going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so that's why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life.

In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don' got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so ""impossible"" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it should't defined who we are. First impressions don't always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking

First, no one is perfect. We aren't perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others don't and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. That's when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we can't change that or let it get the best of us because we aren't perfect and it's okay if sometimes things don't go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again.

Second, it should't defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people don't like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesn't defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isn't you is just a part of you that doesn't think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when it's the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but that's okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that.

Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Let's say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they don't like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they don't. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isn't impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they don't want to and yes there's people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we should't let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We can't make people be our friend if they don't want to. If they want to get to know you they will.

Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and that's okay. We can always try again another day, it should't get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And that's okay, it doesn't defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions should't even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always. Don't let anything like that make you think less of you. "
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on your experiences, do you agree or disagree with Emerson's statement? Take position on this issue. I believe what author Ralph Waldo wrote is true.

First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. I think if you don't work hard for what you want,you will never accomplished it. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. However, someone people have skills, but are not confident with their self. Practice or training will help you be successful.

Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. Now when my teachers asks who wants to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it.

Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. In my second semester i started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Until this day I feel proud of myself too.

In conclusion, you should not give up on something you love to do nor let someone tell you what you can and cannot do. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right , work hard and you will be successful."
"My talent is i'm good at drawing when i draw i like to draw the stars, the moon,woods and the ocean, drawing is a talent where you can express your self by showing multiples of types of art ,there's a lot of types of art my favorite type of art is the one where you draw. When you draw you can do make whatever you want and if you made a mistake you can fix it ,my other favorite type of drawing is the one where you paint, because you can paint what are you feeling like if you're sad,happy,angry,upset. Art is one of my favorite talents i can make whatever i want and peolpe pay a lot of money for the drawings or paints they don't care if they cost billions of dollars they pay it, because it's beautiful art. Art is a talent that a lot people have it, some people are so good at it, that sometimes they think it's not good enought so they decide to throught it away, but they don't know that some peolpe will like it and they will pay it for their art. Art cost a lot of money but some people don't sale their art, because they want to keep it for memory or because they want to show it to their family and sometimes they sale it to their family, but they don'tsale it for billions or millions of dollars,because it's for their family. Smoe peolpe when they make mistakes on their art and they don't fix it and they don't thourght it away they just keep it,because maybe some rich people will buy it.

I think people should try to sale it

,

because they can get a lot of money for their paints or drawings. Art it's a really hard jod you need to be patient, because you might make a mistake and u have to start all over again, people don't start all over again what they do is they can make something beautiful of that mistake and by the way art it's also about you see something ugly, but you can fix it and make look beautiful.

Some people think art it's boring,but it's not, beacuse if you love doing art you don't think it's boring you love doing it, because it makes you happy and sometimes when you're so happy and exited to paint you don't have the control and you just start paint and you dont care if it's ugly you just lating your body do his work, because you're so exited about it that your not even think what is going to look like, sometimes i do the same i late my body to do the work by his self and actully it does fell good you happy and so exited.

Other peolpe get so stress when their work dosen't look how they wanted to be, sometimes i get stress out too, because i think my draw dosen't look good how i wanted to be, but like i said you need to patient, because art is not an easy jod it's hard. But when you get use to it it's hard but not that hard like before, i'm good at art but im still learning and sometimes it's really hard but i need to be patient and keep practicing, because practicing makes the teacher."
"I think that he is right in what he think, about the consists of succession going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, because if you loss your enthusiasm in something that you are doing you loss the interes in it, but if your enthusiasm is to do it, you can do it many times you want the failure is just a little rock in your way to made your personality more incredible and unique from other that just give up at the firts time.

Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to strar something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we don't try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to don't have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesn't give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but your are the only one who accept it or not.

An example of failure can be, ; like when someone went to ask for a job but, he doesn't had the job because he didn't finish the high school that is failure in his life, but he decide to retake the high school in his free time, and he graduate from it, he can back for ask in the same job, he is contracting at this time it was because he has a great enthusiasms in his life, he never stop because he didn't had the job at his first try he continue and he did it.

I know not everything is rose color but sometimes you need a little bit of failure in your life, to see how brave you are and how strong are you for the life situations, failure it's not mean that you are a loser, not it's mean that you are training for the difficult situations in the life but with just a good enthusiasm you can do it again and again has many times you want to do that is my conclusion about how failure can affect your life."
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time.

"In the actuality, many schools have been a good support for all the students that want to continue studying, and have goals for their life, the schools provide opportunities and have partnerships with companies that allow students explore certain occupations.

It's hard for many students to choose the career they want to study, some students leave school after high school, so they loses great opportunities that the school provides, but my dream is to have passion for a job, so I want this opportunity to make a good decision whether if I want to study marketing, through internships and shadowing opportunities that the school provide. I'm really interested in this oportunity because I want to learn more about marketing, which is the business of promoting sales of a product, as by advertising and packaging, also learn about inform new innovations and persuade the people; I'm really creative, I enjoy making posters, using social media, talking with people, and I can speak spanish, english, and a little of french, also I want to have organization and administration of the things, however, I'm interested in pursuing that type of employment, that the manager of a business can tell us his experience, to motivate us because if you want something you will never give up, I will always put all my effort to be a better person.

In conclusion, I hope I can have this opportunity, to make sure if marketing is the job I want for the rest of my life because it's really important to choose the correct job, the people need to have passion for the things that they do , so they can enjoy and be happy everyday, and I want to transmit that feeling for everyone."
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change. Your first thoughts of someone. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Some first impressions can be changed and some can't be.

First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. The way someone's appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached.

My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed.

One major first thoughts of a person can be the way a other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet . There is a lot of people in this world whos first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change. But than theirs many other people whos first impressions are changed.

In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but thats why its called ''first thoughts'' because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently and your thoughts will change.

"BEING YOURSELF.

Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally.

people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are.

The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her.

With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.           "
"Do you want to be board going extra hours to school, when you could be doing fun things? All the sports that you want to do will be ruined if you do homework club. Students should not have after school homework club because you won't have time to spent with family members, students are not going to have time to play there favorite sports, and they won't be able to play their favorite sport.

First of all, students won't spend time with their family. If youre in after school club and your parents are planning to go eat dinner, you are not going to make it. For example, Generic_Name is at school and the day is over but, he needs to go to after school club. Generic_Name call his mother and told her "" Mom i need to stay after school today"" but, his mother told him ""we were going to your favorite restaurant Red Lobster."" Generic_Name upset that we wont be able to go to his favorite restaurant because of after school club. This proves that after school can affect on family time. Generic_Name missed his favorite restaurant

just because school.

Secondly, students won't be able to play sports. If you are in after school club and in a sport your most likely going to be late for your favorite sport. For example, Generic_Name

plays Basketball but he goes to an after school club for English class. On Wednesday Generic_Name needs to go to the after school club, also he has Basketball practice after the club. Generic_Name goes to practice and he is five minutes late the coach tells him that is strike one. PROPER_NAME tried to convince the coach that he was at a club for school, the coach told Generic_Name """"Is either school or Basketball Generic_Name."" Generic_Name got kicked form the team because he got to strike three. This proves that after school club can affect the sport that you play. Generic_Name got kicked from the sport that he loved, and the sport that he though that was going to be his career.

Finally, if you like video games their is only video games

on the weekend if take this club. You are going to come late from school which means that you are not going to be able to play. For example, Generic_Name is a gamer on YouTube he streams every day and plays games for YouTube, but now that he has to go to after school club he can't stream on week days because he gets out of school at 6:30 and the drive home is 30 minutes. So, Generic_Name gets home at 7:00 and he needs to do some of the home work that he didn't got to do on the club and is to late for him. Also, Generic_Name just bought a game and he can only play on the weekends. He lost lots of people that were following him on YouTube just because homework club. Generic_Name was playing for YouTube and had

a lot of people on his stream and lost half of them because after school club.

After school homework club is a waste of time, if you have things to do after school. It's difficult to do two things at once so don't do after school club. If you like doing sports do it because you should do homework at your own time. If you do after school homework club in school for more hours. Don't do after school homework club if you don't want extra time in school.                            "
"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school,

not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students."
"I would have to agree with otherwise you try to do something in other side what you have is already mastered, you will never be successful, because whatever you have in your life is still nothing you should have a specific goal for you future, enough confidence, and demonstrated yourself.

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways. I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they can't do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations. Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful. We all should believing to ourselves and use our abilities in right ways if there is a wish, there is a way for it.              "
"In my opinion as a student: I don't agree at this type of method but the same time is good for students and teachers to learnd everyday, life is like a school we never stop learning something everyday and acquire new expirence and skills in our grammer. I should go neither everybody need their will to vote what they want to do or spend their summer break as they like.

like you see is their break and is not fair to obligate a student to do a project with out a vote to give them a choice to pick if they want to do it or not. Example; like the elections a President can't be a President with out votes, the country pick their own candidates and the citizens give the vote to the person they pick best for their country

Most likely everything have a vote in our community fuction nothing move with out a vote to people is fair to vote,

"I think have a positive effects on people's lives because is for be independent and make more easy your tasks , all humans must to work with technology , some people affect that because they think is negative for a teenagers but in this year all used , we need to modernize and not only for teenagers for all because is for make your hard tasks easy , and all , technology is not just for fun is for make your life more easy.

An example of technology is in schools every schools used for is students , like in my school every student have a chrome book for do tasks and every classwork we due in the chrome book , the teachers have mac's for due tasks and this is my examples to why is positive in our life , i think technology has been modernize , a example is in the hospitals for take care of us we have technology , that is amazing technology can save ours lives.

A reason why have positive feelings about technology is because all examples i give you , another example is the police need technology for catch bad persons and technology make more easy tasks for a cops , god blessed the technology , i think we need technology for modernize , acceptable , and attitude, for a person get used technology is very easy only you need to practice and is a very easy to learned the technology.

I advise technology is for make easy your life that is all , you have work hard to do easy with technology because technology today in day have everything, you are a better person with technology , my thought is one day have we dependent about technology because this is the new fashion and everything , a example is the cars , today every car have technology , my thought is one day technology can make fly cars , and i wish that is the future."
"Having a more advance learning can be beneficial because of career experience, graduating early, and recommendation.

Career experience is important to human society because it is needed in order to earn money. Some school provide programs that have different career. Student can have experience on what is like in the outside world. Without the help of the school program lot of student have difficulty on finding jobs.

Graduating early means that a student have master they're learning. They have the opportunity to start there career that they enjoy and have the requirement. Pre-AP classes, also advance learning can give students scholarship. Pre-AP classes means learning College while in High School.

Recommendation also falls on the same place as graduating early and career experience. When a student have master there learning they get to go to a special school that is more advance than regular school. They have reach the point where they succeed in learning.

Career experience, graduating early, and recommendation are all benefit of advance learning. "
"I think it is a good idea that people should ask for others peoples advice because they can learn extra info from them. Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people. They can also get help someone make a better choice. You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next.

The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions. The more people ask for advice they will get multiple opinions. If I dont ask questions iill never get any responses or advices. So thast why I think people should ask for others peoples advice all the time.

"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. does curfew help teenagers or not help teenagers. Curfew is a bad idea because curfew do not help teenagers on weekday and also the weekends. My tops three reasons are stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can get in trouble.

When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didn't check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys. When my friends drop me off at my house and i open door of my house than i saw my parents sleeping and the next day my mom ask if i came back to the house at my curfew and i said yes and i got always with it.

Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. Some may say that curfew help teenagers to be home on time. They are wrong because most teenagers sink out of their bed room window. One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she could't sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didn't our parents.

Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had. When teenagers are in trouble the person they go running to is their parents because they know they something bad and now they need help for it. On a weekend my friends and i are doing weed in one of my friend basement and her parents catch us doing weed and her parents told my parents. When i got home my parents were in the table and we all talk. My parents told me to stop doing weed so i did but few years later i was doing weed again and again they found out somehow. We talk about it now i stop doing weed for good.

Curfew is a bad idea on a weekday and weekends. Curfew do not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends because they can stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can in trouble. This are all my tops three reasons."

"i strongly agree when the Former British Minister Winston Churchill say how failure takes a extremely important position in success. To success you have to fail many times as you need to the same thing so you can get it right and success on in. Success is the desire of outcome in many goals in life, is the gaining of wealth and fame,

Success is to attain desire of doing what you like even know you are going to have to fail on it many times doing in it.

Success consists of going from failure to failure because nothing is perfect in life. During life you are always going to have ups and downs everyday, you are going to lose people because you might be doing something that they don't like or maybe You might be facing some obstacles that stops you from success and doing what you like. During success you are going to lose your enthusiasm in what you are trying to success in. You are going to start thinking i can't do this because i have done it many times and i always fail on it or i can't do this because my friend's and family members say i can't do it because when i do it i always comes up wrong.

Failure consists in falling to do something,it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. you are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it ,

you have to take steps by steps to do it. there are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. there are going to be times where people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you can't do it just because its your first time trying it and you fail it in your first time. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. but you have to always keep your enthusiasm up.

Because enthusiasm consists in strong and a warm feeling that tells you that you re always have to keep strong and keep your head up in what you are doing.

""success consists of going from a failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""is one of the Quotes you always have to keep on mind when you are doing something the first time. Ia the quote that you have too keep on mind when people tells you that you cant do anything because you fail it your first time. is the quote you have to keep on mind when you fail the first time and the the second time you got it right. thats where you are going to known the meaning of the quote. and you are going to see that all hard work you have done it was for a purpose to success more in life. maybe you might lost people during that battle but when you know the meaning of the quote and you understand it you are going to know that everything was for a purpose in life and after all you when through you success a lot in your life.

"A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life.

You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.

You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? that's is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldn't go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.

After years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.

In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Your positive attitude will not take you anywhere.       "
"Sucsses is the common word that we hear every day, and everyone want to became successful in their life.

The first step of a person toward sucsses is school, and it is the golden part of our life, and to make it more enjoyable and comfortable for a student, school and teachers let us do some educational and exciting drama role plays, do a funny science experiment, and let them play their favorite instrument.

Today, we got some talented actors,comedians, actresses and etc, but they were also students in a time and were sitting on the chairs that we are sitting now. They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy.

The technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future.

Every student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime. The most popular talent among students is music. Because music directly touch your heart, and make you focus on it. Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that.

At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something. Because school is our main resourse of learning.                                      "
"Most students who want to graduate before the years, that they should be take. Students with the capacity of make their mind strongest, go to their limits, and make one year early. Schools that allow students make more short their school years, if better for most of students who want get their diplomas, enter college, and start a career. Students who have a lot responsibilities and their want a diploma. These program is good to make steps in life. I think college do not have a specific age, just with your goals to make everything without leave school is strong enough to make a year early.

Those plans do not make problem, if just a way to finish what you want many people admire those people and see their potential. when a student have a early year because want a start to make a goals. If you see, passed, and remember high school lesson you will be fine, if you study and make your task these option will be good. Many reasons that take people to get these program, if because they usually do not have enough money, have to work, and need to study at the same time, everyone do not have the same opportunity opt for study during summer or online classes.

If you analyze students work after school, they want to get a diploma and make a force one year, when they make get one year less that say you are study and passed your classes different can be when teachers give you a year when you don't know nothing and teachers approve your year that's different go college when you have no idea how react to many classes than you never see or never show during the period of high school, the students that study during summers or in the evenings are focus in their classes that's because they finish fast and go college to involve in a new goal.

Example if you go school and need to work you'll to opt for study in summer or in the evenings that's your best option, students follow to take courses because it's a better idea maybe do not be the same learning, but with effort you can advance. Is not important how many years do you spend in high school, the think is what is your percent of each class. how you can involve in college: studying, focus, and remember what you see or learn.

In conclusion each student have different way to think how want to study and how many time want to spend in high school. Most students who take this decision if because they have to work and can spend much time, and they sacrifice some summers or evenings to get close their goals and each one do what is more beneficiary for their way. For me, if a good option opt for finish fast school and start a new stage in our life."

I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.

First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.

Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.

Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am.

To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are."
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them.

"In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone. ""Super Smash Brothers"" brings others closer together with their families and friends."
"Self-confidence is really important for people to feel good about their own selves. Building self-confidence may be hard on some students because the way they was raise or the way they are treated by others; Students should be able to build up self-esteem for their own good reasons in life, learning may be hard on some students at first but is just one of the task they have to get through putting a lot of effort in to it wot be that hard getting it done will be; Others may believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. Students should be able to do work that they understand good enough at their own risk to make the effort of being self-confident. Some people may not agree just because building up self-confidence is not an easy thing to do or even an easy thing to accomplish in life. Does true Self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievements? Self-esteem comes from achievements; Achievements that you got to make the risk for put up in life throughout school. There i'll be some difficult times where you will want to give up in life times where you will feel like you just can't do it anymore, but students struggle with their own personal problems but they can get through it all and that is what makes the build-up self-confidence about the risk and task they make in life."
"In the quote, Thomas Jeff er son take about determine will never to be idle and wonderful to be if all of come to and accomplish many thing come to one people and serve purpose in you life.

IN my point of view, Thomas Jefferson tray to say if all of the colonies come and vote if they wont to stay with under grate British control or come join to fight for Avery freedom. bay the way do not frogat we blood for British we die for British we won France Indian and war in the end what the king do take all new land control if we can not go in the new land because kings and they friends or nobles can go to the new land. then way we have to pay tax to a king who do not care about his people in the colonies,But only care about money and power he wont then. what you wont no one say nothing then

Jones watches say if we do not fight we living a life like slaves,

Thomas Jefferson and Jones watches and they great people in end one man can not hand wide of the earth to gad come groups we can to anything."
"Well In this part I

think is good and bad idea.

I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.

the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision.

if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn,

they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.

If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.

If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up.

if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.

so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work. "
"According to the Generic_School, that believe that 70% high school students change their mind about what career they want to do after high school. I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of students don't even have in mind what they're trying to do after high school, another reason is that they're way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course.

High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or wanna go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you don't be confused about what you going do in college and he told me that he's trying go to a different school because that school doesn't let him change his courses because he was trying be a firefighter but now he change his mind and want to a doctor.

We high school students are way to young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents.

My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying do in my opinion they should let us do that on the student's senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now he's a senior and he's going to be doctor so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class.

In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctor's relate classes so you can get use to do things that doctors does."

"Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning."
"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because it's pointless, unfair, and not important.

To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. It's also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. It's no where near educational related. It wouldn't be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class.

The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless.

In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. it's not important for students to take any of those classes. It's not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs don't require for you to have any of those classes.                      "
It has been aid that first impressions are almost impossible to change. For me i think you can change from the first impression. First of all you can come off as someone who don't care about anything or any one but when you get to know them your mindset change on how they are in your eyes. the second reason is i had someone that i thought that was the one the person i thought i can spend my life with i know it sounds crazy but my first impression was she was a good girl then i got to know her and found out she's nothing but plane evil and has nothing but hate in her soul and always trying to find something to blame me for just looking for es cues for her to do what she wants to do and Little do she knows its making my love for her fading away every step of the way. so in conclusion this is why i think that first impression arent really impossible to change because people family even loved ones change that why i think first impression can change.
"I think sometime is good online because any students no have time so many students work part time,then can't go to the school the better option is take a little free time and make online.

First :But is better they go to the school because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes .

second : some times the students no came at the school because they live long them no have money for transportation or when need buy any book ,any students don't have the support of your family ,i think is the way more easy and very well for the people can do it some thing ,we need more people have want learning more the way the best election for our the student speaks , writes and lives not on a thing barren changeless level but with all the breadth and height and depht and movement yyou have a right to as a human being .As you ever open discover those words ,the online can be the most important web you ever open.

Third:There are probably very few people would claim online las their favorite book .However all the words are there ,it is the order ,But if you need company whose work it is to prepare materials that advance your learning and show you how to think for yourselves , the online web is the reason the words stand for things and feelings , from outline and notes to the final form of the paper .It tells you how to write paper .how prepare for applying for a job .However It gives you advice you need to choose the correct language and to avoid expressions ,after its helps you understanding their parts and pronunciation .

Finally : The online web is very well for everybody because in the web we can find the signification about whatever word, that we dont know and helps for keep going more learning for get good job ,after you can use the online web for look video that you are curious then helps own like better people make our life better for everybody, if you dont know the support your family the class online help for you keep gonig learning more ."
"When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?

Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.

When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. But many might not go for that career in the future . Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.

I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. They do not like going to work as much. Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as.

In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.

Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age. "
"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. There is a quote that says, ""If you want to go fast go by yourself, but if you want to far go with someone else"". As the quote says, I think that it's very important to have someone to guide us throughout the course of our lives. I agree that seeking for guidance from experts to make wise decisions can have a great impact in our lives. Experts and authorities can provide us with advices to make good decisions in life and accomplish our goals more easily.

First of all, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life could help you accomplish a goal a lot easier. For example, when I was in middle school I used to think that doing individual work was faster and easier. However, I noticed that most of my classmates who worked in groups finished all the assignments in less time than I did. This experience showed me the importance of always having someone to give you their opinion to accomplish a goal quickly and avoid wasting your time. Thus, seeking for guidance from experts can help you achieve any goal you set in life and avoid wastig your time on making wrong decisions.

In addition, you will learn and gain experience if you have someone expert to guide you. For example, having an expert guiding you will allow you to see his different points of view and learned from his teachings. This will allow you to learn from his teachings and experiences and reflect about them. Furthermore, relying on with an expert will give you the chance to learn new lessons and in the future give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. Finally,

you will learn how to make wise choices by learning from the lessons that an expert or authority could offer you.

Some people say that having someone telling you what to do will limit you from choosing what's best for you. For instance, when I was 10 years old I really wanted to make my own decisions that I thought were best for me. In whatever manner, I rarely got to choose my own decisions because my brother was always there telling what decisions to make. As I grew older I understood that my brother was just guiding me through the right path. Because my brother had experienced many of the situations I went through, he was able to help me and in many occasions avoid me from failing. Therefore, experts and authorities will be there to not let you fail and always look for what's best for you.

In conclusion, seeking from guidance from experts may not give you the freedom to make your own decisions, but it will help you accomplish your goals rapidly and efficiently. Since experts have already experienced many rough situations in life, they will know how to make decisions that will benefit us in the best way. Furthermore, in the course of the path with an expert guiding you, you will learn a lot of things that will help you make better choices. Finally, you will avoid wasting a lot of your life's time trying to follow your own instincts and ideas. "

"when i first came to the U.S.A

i was not able to speak English, and every time i went out to play or go to school people were showing me examples of what to do or where to do same for me if i want to go play soccer or go to the play ground ill point outside the window or draw a picture of it, i tried to come up with anther way to example what i want but examples was the only think avalibel for me until i learned English.

Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because,thats the only way others will figure out what you talking about examples is what everyone use to help each other to also understand each other however,others say that example is not the mine thing to influencing other because, there are many other things to influence others for example, Google translator,Google,YouTube there is a lot of other apps that help to influence others.

i agree that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because , example is used every where and most of the time even when you want to speak to someone with another language and also kids see adult people as an example too them they see what they do and copy them example is used with everything for ex, for parents if they want there kid to be good they got to be an example of them or they have to show them an example of something or someone how to be behavior is one of the most important things because it show others hot to act and it it gives other people example of how to act in a sernat place for ex,if a kid go to a library and see tow adult being loud and playing around he going to do the same because he think that they doing the right thing because they are adult and should know how to act in place like that .

wall others say that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others because there are more thing that we can influence each others with technology made a lot for us that we can help and influence each other with other ways for ex, Google translator if i go to another country i dont need to show people examples of a museum or draw i can type it and show them or say it to them and they will give me direction and students that dont speak English can use a dictionary or Google to help them understand.
