"Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they won't be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc.

A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they won't have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home.

Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs.

Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money.

In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesn't have a day off, but it is okay for him. My mom, she doesn't work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldn't be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.

In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.",AI
"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also won't be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didn't understand in the class.

I think Schools should not control students involvents.

Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students. When students are responsible with their shool work, and their activities, they should get extra credit.      ",AI
"Agree you will never grow if something beyond of what you have mastered. However, some people believe that you don't have to do this to grow that you can grow conform the time. Emerson's was right with this quote people have think more then just of what they believe, if they grow they will achieve their dreams if they achieve they will grow you just have to believe in what you are.

Unless you try to do something respect, you have to do the best of you if you want to grow. Base in my experiences I'm growing, I try hard, and I try to convince the other do to the same, we want a better world we students to grow if they grow this will be a proud for the others. If we don't an open mind this will be the opposite we will never grow,no matter what is happening he we have to grow.

At the end of all of this we will have something do where we can be support our live, always come something better, you have to be organize with your things. The idea is to be your self don't ever let other people to control you just be you, and the decision is on you.

Don't you ever be an a position to where you have to decide between to options? That's when you to believe in yourself, to thing want your want to be grow or stay in the floor. If you grow will be more opportunities for you and maybe don't just for you can be for the others who are around of you.

Give the best of you to make it, for example if you don't try to grow what will be of you what kind of person you will be.

There are benefits to grow like you can be a person who can do almost all the things ,you can be accept or be sociable. Emerson gave us a great point with this statement we have to appreciate of what he wrote in my view he completeright about to try something beyond what you have already, just try and you can make it.",AI
"I think our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed. As children begin to go to school, most often they meet other kids and become friends. Friends also have an influence on how traits are formed like for example: Kindness, friendly, honest, and more. The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm. These traits for formed because of school and my friends. John Lubock mentions that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I think that this quote explains that you are able to choose it by yourself. I disagree and I believe that other humans make our character traits.",AI

Becoming a surgeon requires a great deal of dedication and hard work. After completing undergraduate schooling, individuals must go through four years of medical school to earn a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). After completing medical school, individuals must complete, on average, another five to seven years of residency training in a hospital, depending on the specialty, in order to receive a license. Once a license has been obtained, individuals can specialize in various areas such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, general surgery, and plastic surgery. Committing a large amount of time to the job is essential for those wishing to pursue a career in surgery.",human

Schools should offer an after school homework club in order to support students and their academic success. The club would provide a place for students to complete their homework with the help of their peers and staff. There are three points to consider when advocating for an after school homework club: access to the resources needed, more contact time with teachers, and providing a community support system. 

First, an after school homework club would give students more access to the resources they need to complete their assignments. It would be a great place for students in need of tutoring or help with their homework to find the assistance they need. This would allow them to move past any challenging subjects and have the ability to learn more effectively.

Second, the club would provide more contact time with teachers that can provide above and beyond instruction. This open environment would allow students to get the one-on-one help they need to understand course material. In addition, it would allow teachers to observe student progress in a less formal setting, and provide better feedback on students enrollment and test taking performance. 

Finally, the club would provide a community support system for students. It would be a space for them to talk to their peers over a common interest or goal -homework- instead of a distraction like social media. This would be beneficial in allowing students to find support from their friends and allow them to gain confidence and self-esteem.

Overall, an after school homework club would give more access to the resources needed, a chance for more contact with teachers, and provide a community support system. These reasons make it essential that schools must offer an after school homework club to ensure the success of their students.",human

It? human nature to be afraid to make mistakes, but making mistakes is part of life and often leads to personal growth and development. Even though making mistakes can be discouraging, it is important to know that these missteps are only temporary and do not equate to failure. It is better to break rules than never to have taken a risk at all. Making mistakes can be a valuable lesson in problem solving, adapting to new situations, and making breakout moves that will potentially lead to success. 

It? okay to make mistakes amid the process of achieving success. Making mistakes doesn? mean you have to scrap your current project and start over. Instead, use your mistakes to create a plan and come up with a new strategy. Being able to move on from mistakes and capitalize on what you?e learned is what sets successful people apart from those who give up.

Overall, mistakes are inevitable, but they don't necessarily mean one has failed. Mistakes should be seen as an opportunity to learn and improve. Understanding mistakes can be immensely helpful in striving for success in the long run.",human

One of the main debates of 2020 for many students is whether attending classes from home is beneficial or detrimental. It is undeniable that virtual education has its advantages and disadvantages that must be deeply considered when making the decision of whether to attend classes physically or virtually. 

For starters, classes from home allow students to go at their own pace, as well as giving them the opportunity to work on their own and on their own time. This can lead to a more personal and self-motivated learning experience. Additionally, by learning from home there is no need to worry about a long commute: this can free up more time for studying and leisure activities. Furthermore, students become more comfortable using technology and digital tools, which can give them a head start in their professional career.

On the other hand, there are also numerous negative aspects that students should take into account regarding classes from home. As virtual instruction eliminates in-person contact, it can be harder to expand the student's knowledge base and nurture their creative thought processes. Additionally, when learning from home, students can sometimes become more isolated and distracted, which can lead to a decrease in concentration, low motivation, and reduced academic performance. 

In conclusion, there are both benefits and drawbacks to taking classes from home, but each student should carefully consider their own situation and prioritize their individual needs when deciding whether remote education is the best option for them.",human

The implementation of a curfew for teenagers can provide numerous benefits for both the teens and their families. Curfews can promote safety by keeping teens off the streets at night, when they are more likely to experience danger. They can also provide a sense of structure and discipline, as teens must adhere to a set timeframe for being home. For parents, curfews can provide them with peace of mind, knowing that their children are safe and secure. In addition, curfews can help teens maintain a healthy sleep schedule and encourage healthy behavior by limiting access to activities that may be deemed as bad for their health. Ultimately, the benefits of a curfew depend on the individual circumstances, but they can provide a safe environment for teens and families.",human
