one of my favourite hobbies is learning languages . Not only does it boosts your self-confidence but also your communication skills. Imagine being able to speak to all people in the world . What a super power !

Hey Koky You know what? It was a long time ago since I last met you, I missed you so much but most likely you don't even remember me or make much effort to remember me. I'm trying to convince myself that you know me and if I told you that I love you with every bit of my heart, you will have the same feeling for me but I'm too afraid to get shocked from you, get shocked from the last chance I found to give meaning for my life, to find something I live for.

I have a lot of problems in my life, I found suicide is the best solution for every problems in this life, but suicide is solution for a problem that can be solved earlier, it can be solved earlier if people believe in antinatalism which is the best logical solution but people don't want to believe in it as they just think about being parents without spending a milli second thinking about the coming child or the sufferings he/she will face.
